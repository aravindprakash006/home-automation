Level-3: SMART HOME AUTOMATION SYSTEM USING IOT

In a Level-3 IoT system for smart home automation, multiple nodes strategically placed throughout the home environment are equipped with sensors for detecting various parameters such as motion, temperature, humidity, and light levels. These nodes autonomously collect and process data on-site, analyzing patterns and anomalies to facilitate automated control of home appliances and systems. The system integrates with cloud-based storage and analytics platforms for centralized data management and advanced insights, enabling users to remotely monitor and control their home environment for enhanced comfort, convenience, and energy efficiency.

Components:

1. ESP32 Microcontroller: The ESP32 serves as the central control unit in the home automation system. It connects to the internet and communicates with the relay board to control the appliances.

2. Relay Board: The relay board acts as a switch for controlling electrical appliances. It is connected to the ESP32 and the appliances, allowing the ESP32 to turn them on or off remotely.

3. Google Home: Google Home provides voice control functionality to the system. Users can issue voice commands to control the appliances connected to the system.

4. Synric Pro: Synric Pro is a service that enables the integration of IoT devices with voice assistants like Google Home. It facilitates communication between the ESP32 and Google Home, allowing seamless control of home appliances.
